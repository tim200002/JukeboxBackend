# Jukebox Backend

This is the Backend of my Spotify Jukebox APP.
It uses a MongoDB Database to Store objects.
One can communicate with the Backend via a REST-API.
In Addition to this the Backend also supports Websockets (Socket-IO) to update the User Interface of the App and the Webinterface in realtime.
